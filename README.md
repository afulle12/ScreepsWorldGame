This is my repo where I push my Screeps code. It's good to keep it here just in case and to display some of my code.
I used AI at every step of the way but I've had to define how I wanted the Screeps to operate and the rules + priorities they need to consider.
In the beginning, I just asked the AI to set everything up which only got me so far, I had to have clear expectations for what I'm looking for and I have to debug strange and complicated problemms that come along.

This game has made coding fun again!
