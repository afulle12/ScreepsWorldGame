We need to update README to reflect current code, note disabled features (e.g., remoteHarvester disabled). Also reflect new features: factory manager, terminal manager, etc. Provide sections: Overview, Features (list), Disabled features note. Provide console commands list. Ensure formatting guidelines: use hyphens for lists, proper hierarchy. Use code formatting for commands. Use markdown.

We need to produce updated README.

Let's produce sections:

- Project Overview
- Core Systems
  - Creep Roles (list)
  - Defense & Infrastructure
  - Colony & Resource Management
  - Performance & Analytics
- New Features (list)
- Disabled / Not functional features (list with note)
- Console Commands (grouped)
- Installation / Usage (maybe)
- Contributing (optional)

Make sure to use hyphens for lists, no mixed bullet/number.

Use code blocks for code snippets.

Make sure to use proper markdown.

Let's craft.

# Screeps Colony – README  

*Version: 2025‑08‑13*  

---

## 📖 Overview  

This repository powers a **multi‑room AI colony** for **Screeps World**.  
The codebase is a blend of AI‑generated scaffolding and extensive manual tuning.  
All core decisions—creep roles, resource logistics, combat, expansion—are
hand‑crafted and continuously refined through live‑game testing.

The system is **modular**: each subsystem lives in its own module and is
invoked from the main loop (```module.exports.loop```).  
The most recent changes add a **Factory Manager**, a **Terminal Manager**, and a
full‑featured **Scout** with intelligent path‑finding and danger‑avoidance.

---

## 🧩 Core Systems  

### 1️⃣ Creep Roles  

| Role | Primary duties | Highlights |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **🧑‍🌾 Harvester** | Harvests sources, caches source assignments, idle‑by‑source when empty. | Source‑balancing, regeneration‑aware waiting, per‑room cache. |
| **⚡ Upgrader** | Refills controller, pulls energy from storage / container / link. | Cached controller, fast source lookup, fallback to harvesting. |
| **🔨 Builder** | Global job queue (repair, build, wall repair). | Cached room data, priority‑tiered job selection, idle‑spot logic. |
| **🔭 Scout** | Exploration, path‑finding, danger detection, black‑listing. | Stuck detection, local & mission blacklists, auto‑explorer. |
| **🛡️ Defender** | Ranged combat, IFF whitelisting, target‑switching. |
| **⚔️ Attacker** | Console‑orderable attacks, rally system, custom path‑finding with blacklists. |
| **🔋 Supplier** | Energy logistics (storage, terminal, containers, links). | Task‑priority system, anti‑stuck logic, dynamic rerouting. |
| **🗺️ Claimbot** | Claims or attacks controllers, edge‑avoidance, path‑finder to target. |
| **💎 Miner** | Extracts minerals, drops them immediately. |
| **🧪 Extractor** | Harvests minerals from extractor, drops into container. |
| **🧪 FactoryBot** | Feeds factories, evacuates finished product, drains leftovers. |
| **🧟‍♂️ Thief** | Steals resources from enemy structures, returns home. |
| **⚡ TowerDrain** | Positions on room border, retreats to heal, returns home. |
| **💣 Demolition** | Demolition‑team logic (demolisher + collector). |
| **🧱 RemoteHarvester** *(disabled)* | Tiered body scaling, long‑distance harvesting. |
| **🧱 Scavenger** | Picks up dropped resources, delivers to storage. |
| **🪧 Signbot** | Signs room controllers. |
| **🛠️ SquadMember** | Part of a 2×2 quad squad (attack, heal, pack). |
| **🧑‍🔧 TerminalBot** | Handles terminal operations (buy/sell/transfer). |
| **🧱 RoadTracker** *(optional, disabled)* | Tracks road usage, visualises over‑/under‑used tiles. |

> **Note** – The **RemoteHarvester** role is currently **disabled** (see *Disabled Features*).  

---

### 2️⃣ Defense & Infrastructure  

- **Advanced Tower Logic** – Prioritises healers, repairs, and wall‑repair; IFF whitelist prevents friendly fire.  
- **Link Network** – Classifies links (donor, storage, recipient) and balances energy.  
- **Smart Path‑finding** – Used by scouts, attackers, and squads; includes stuck detection and dynamic blacklisting.  
- **Road & Container Management** – Supplier role balances containers (donor / hybrid / recipient) and handles terminal‑energy balancing.  

---

### 3⚙️ Colony & Resource Management  

- **Dynamic Creep Scaling** – Body tiers per room energy; emergency spawns when energy low.  
- **Emergency Harvesters** – Spawned when no harvesters exist.  
- **Low‑Energy Spawn Dampening** – Delays spawns when total energy < 800.  
- **CPU & Performance Profiling** – ```screeps-profiler``` integrated, toggleable.  
- **Analytics** – GCL/RCL ETA, per‑room creep stats, CPU usage logs, energy‑income tracking, daily kill counter.  

---

## ✨ New Features (since previous README)

- **Factory Manager (```factoryManager.js```)**  
  - FIFO per‑room factory orders, automatic hauler spawning (```factoryBot```).  
  - Supports all basic recipes (Oxidant, Reductant, Bar‑types, Purifier).  
  - Handles order completion, draining leftovers, and safe shutdown.  

- **Terminal Manager (```terminalManager.js```)**  
  - **Hard‑cap**: exactly **one** terminal bot per room (alive + spawning + requested).  
  - Bots **auto‑switch** to ENERGY when needed for transfers.  
  - **Per‑operation spawn policy** – console commands can request a bot (```spawn``` flag) or suppress spawning (```nospawn```).  
  - **Operations**: ```marketBuy```, ```marketSell```, ```transferStuff```.  
  - **Operation‑bot linking** – bots automatically pick up pending operations.  
  - **Terminal‑busy detection** – prevents concurrent transfers in the same room.  
  - **Email/notification** support (toggleable).  

- **Scout Enhancements**  
  - Local blacklist for stuck rooms, automatic back‑track avoidance.  
  - Path‑finder missions with persistent blacklists.  
  - Detailed danger detection (hostile creeps, towers, IFF).  

- **Supplier Anti‑Stuck & Reroute**  
  - Stuck detection, side‑step, reroute windows, and step‑aside logic.  
  - Prioritised task selection (energy, minerals, container balancing).  

- **Squad Module**  
  - Quad‑packed formation, cost‑matrix transformation for 2×2 movement.  
  - Healing logic, packing area management, packing‑area cleanup.  

- **Terminal Bot Run Wrapper**  
  - ```runTerminalBot``` can be called from the main loop or managed directly by ```terminalManager```.  

- **Console Commands** (updated, see **Command Reference** below).
