# Screeps AI Colony Manager

A personal implementation of AI-controlled colony management for [Screeps: World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/464350/Screeps_World/), the MMO strategy game for programmers.

## About This Project

This repository contains my evolving codebase for **Screeps**, where I program the AI behavior of my colony units (creeps) using JavaScript. While I've leveraged AI tools throughout development, the strategic decisions, operational rules, and priority systems are all custom-designed based on my gameplay experience.

## What is Screeps?

Screeps is a unique MMO strategy game where you control your colony by writing JavaScript code. Your code runs 24/7 on game servers, managing everything from resource harvesting to territorial expansion and combat.

## Development Journey

- **Initial Setup**: Started with AI-assisted boilerplate code to understand the basics
- **Custom Strategy**: Developed my own rules for creep behavior, resource management, and colony priorities
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging complex interactions between multiple creeps and game mechanics
- **Continuous Evolution**: Code evolves as I discover new strategies and optimize existing ones

## Key Features

- Automated resource harvesting and management
- Dynamic creep role assignment
- Colony expansion logic
- Defense mechanisms
- *[Add more specific features as you implement them]*

## Why This Repository?

- **Backup**: Cloud storage for my colony's "brain"
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates problem-solving and JavaScript skills
- **Learning**: Track my progress and coding improvements over time

## Personal Note

This game has **made coding fun again!** There's something incredibly satisfying about watching your code come to life as creeps scurry around following your instructions, building and defending your colony while you sleep.

*Note: This is an active project that evolves with my gameplay. Expect frequent updates and experimental features.*
